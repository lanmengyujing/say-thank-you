## Say Thank You in English — Professional Situations
If you are writing an official business email or business letter, then it’s best to use professional, formal expressions to show your thanks or appreciation.

For example, you may be writing to thank someone or to thank another company for their help. Or perhaps you want to express your gratitude for them working with you this year.

 

**Thank you for your assistance with… / Thank you for your attention to this matter**

- “Thank you for your assistance with/attention to this matter. We look forward to hearing from you shortly.”
 

**Your support is greatly appreciated. / I’d like to express my/our appreciation for… / Thank you for your kind consideration.**

- “Your support in this discussion is greatly appreciated and we look forward to continuing our work with you.”
- “On behalf of our company, I’d like to sincerely express our appreciation for your business this year. We wish you Happy Holidays and look forward to another successful year together.”
