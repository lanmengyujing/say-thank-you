## Say Thank You in English — Casual Situations


Did your friend just wish you and your husband a happy anniversary? Did your office celebrate your birthday with cake? Did a stranger hold a door open for you at the post office?

For these everyday, informal experiences, we can use a variety of expression to say thanks.

**Thank you. / Thanks so much. / Thanks a lot. / Thanks a bunch. / Thanks a ton. / Thanks!**

Did your colleague at work just bring you a cup of coffee? Say:

- “Thanks a bunch! I really need an extra dose of caffeine right now!”
- “Thanks! You’re awesome for thinking of me.”
- “Thank you!”
 

I really appreciate it. / You shouldn’t have.

Did your office just give you a birthday gift or a surprise party at work? Say:

- “I can’t believe you did this! You shouldn’t have. But thank you so much. This was very kind of you.”
- “What a thoughtful gift. I really appreciate this!”
 

I don’t know what to say! / That’s very kind.

A stranger on the street just gave you a compliment. Say:

- “I don’t know what to say. Thank you.”
- “That’s very kind of you. Thank you.”
 

**You’re the best. / I owe you one. / You rock.**

Your friend at work stayed late to help you finish a project.

- “You’re the best. I wouldn’t have finished this on time without you.”
- “I really owe you one. Thanks for staying late. Next time you need help, I’ve got it.”
 

**What would I do without you? / To say thank you is not enough. / I can’t thank you enough.**

You had a stressful and difficult day at work. Your husband said he would take care of dinner and do all the cleanup. Say:

- “What would I do without you? You’re wonderful.”
- “I can’t thank you enough. I really need a night off.”
